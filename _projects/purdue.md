Purdue provided me with a challenging education as well as numerous unique opportunities, both in and outside of the classroom. I was able to take classes in a variety of subjects, ranging from entrepreneurship and brand management, to computer science and data analytics. My curriculum included a number of real-world projects including developing a full brand strategy for a startup and creating a strategic growth plan for a local payroll company.


Outside of the classroom, I was able apply my education through numerous extracurriculars. I was involved in Purdue University Dance Marathon and Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity all 4 years, and served as an orientation leader for the Boiler Gold Rush new student orientation my Sophomore year.
